It ain't the way you move
It ain't the way that you move me
Oh no
It ain't the way you shake
It ain't the way that you shake me
Oh no
I've lived 25 years
I'm a kid on the run
I got a pistol for action

Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me
I don't want to know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me
I don't want to know

I love the way you use
I love the way that you use me
Oh yeah
I love the way you shoot
I love the way that you shoot to kill me
Oh yeah
It's taken miles of lines
To learn the right from the wrong
I'll keep you hangin on

Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me
I don't want to know
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me you love me
Don't tell me
I don't want to know
