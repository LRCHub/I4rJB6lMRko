Yeah you know I'm always by your side
So just listen
Babe
Feels like only yesterday
Guess the memories never fade away
So many dreams we've been chasing together
We've been through the tears and the laughter
Now we've found a happy ever after
I got you and that's all that matters
I'm so glad you're in my life
No-one knows me
Like you do, honestly
Better than I know myself
All I need is you
Just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends
Until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way
We can't lose
Always Me + You
It still feels the same
And though the seasons change
Through the ups and the downs
You stay my main
Cause girl, one look in my eye and you read my
mind
We got a connection that gets stronger every
time
Ride or die
I won't take you for granted
A shoulder to cry on, I got it
So reach out your hand and I'll grab it
Day or night, I hold you down
No-one knows me
Like you do, honestly
Better than I know myself
All I need is you
Just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends
Until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way
We can't lose
Always Me + You
All I know, it just gets better with time
When you're feeling so down and lonely
I'll be there come rain or shine
Oh, if you don't already know
There's nothing that I won't do
It's always
Me + You
Oh yeah
Ain't no thing, it's just me + you
All I need is you
Just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends
Until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way
We can't lose
Always Me + You
Oh yeah
I gotta tell you
Always Me + You
